## Factors to consider in determining the Matariki holiday
### Friday
It is always a Friday. How to determin the day of the week depends on the language you use. In Javascript, for example, is the [`getDate()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getDay) of the `Date` class. 
### Moon Phase
It is a Tangaroa night. There are normally 4 Tangaroa nights in a Māori lunar month, Tangaroa-ā-mua, Tangaroa-ā-roto, Tangaroa whakapau, and Tangaroa whāriki kiokio. In a 30-night month, these are the 23th to 26th nights. However, Tangaroa are the 23th to 25th nights in a 29-night months. As in Traditional Chinese Calendar, a Māori month starts at new moon.
